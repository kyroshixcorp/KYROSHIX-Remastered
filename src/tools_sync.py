"""Syncs the live tool registry into config/tools.yml on startup.

We walk every @register_tool class plus the emotion declarations and
plugin folders, then make sure each tool name appears in tools.yml so
the operator can flip it on/off in the configurator. New stuff defaults
to enabled so the user never silently loses a tool after an update.

The file is split into two top level sections:

    tools:           # built-in tools that ship with the host
      <name>: bool
    plugin_tools:    # modular plugin tools, grouped per plugin
      <plugin_name>:
        <name>: bool

Whether the plugin itself is loaded is governed by the plugin's own
plugin.yml `enabled:` flag, NOT by anything in tools.yml. The toggles
under plugin_tools.<plugin> only control which of that plugin's tools
get exposed to gemini once the plugin is loaded.

This file gets touched at startup AFTER plugins have been discovered and
loaded so plugin tools are in the registry by the time we sync.

This file is auto-managed. On every startup ProjectGabriel walks the
live tool registry and adds any newly discovered tool here, defaulting
it to enabled. Your existing values are never overwritten, so anything
you change in here sticks across upgrades.

Schema:
  tools:                 # built-in tools shipped with the host
    <tool_name>: bool
    <tool_name>:
      enabled: bool
      type: auto | blocking | non_blocking
      scheduling: when_idle | interrupt | silent
  plugin_tools:          # tools added by modular plugins, grouped per plugin
    <plugin_name>:
      <tool_name>: bool

The short `tool: true/false` form still works and is the same as
`tool: {enabled: true}`. Use the long form when you want to set a type.

type:                    # when the model has to wait for a tool result
  auto         default. leaves the decision to the model, which is
               blocking on older models and non-blocking on 3.8 models.
  blocking     the model pauses and waits for the result. Predictable
               ordering, but the conversation stalls while the tool runs.
  non_blocking the tool runs in the background and the model keeps
               talking. Required by gemini-3.8-live-extended-thinking,
               which rejects blocking calls outright.

scheduling:              # only used by non-blocking tools
  when_idle    default. model finishes what it is saying, then mentions
               the result.
  interrupt    model cuts itself off to report the result straight away.
  silent       model never mentions it, just knows it for later.

Examples:
  tools:
    vrchatJump: false                  # turn a tool off
    playMusic:
      enabled: true
      type: non_blocking               # start it, keep talking
      scheduling: silent               # then never bring it up
  plugin_tools:
    example_plugin:
      someTool: false                  # plugin still loads, tool hidden

Settings a model cannot honor are dropped automatically and the reason
is printed in the console on startup, so a wrong pick never breaks a
session.
