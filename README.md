# Project Gabriel

A real-time AI companion built for VRChat. Gabriel walks around, talks to people, remembers who they are, and has his own personality. He listens through Gemini Live's native audio streaming, sees through computer vision, and controls his avatar through OSC. Built by [Hoppou AI](https://hoppou.ai).

**VRChat is completely optional.** Gabriel runs just fine without it: you can talk to him through Discord, the WebUI, or any other interface. He was designed around VRChat and that's where he shines brightest, but nothing locks you into it. The Discord bot, social server, and local backend all work standalone.

Most of the well known VRChat AI companions out there are either closed source, locked behind a paywall, or both. Gabriel breaks that pattern. He is free, open source, and designed so anyone with a Gemini API key and a Windows machine can have their own AI companion without paying a cent or signing up for someone else's service. That's the whole point.

## Generated full body motion

Ask him to dance, sit down, or do a backflip and a text-to-motion diffusion model generates it live, streamed onto his avatar at 20fps. No mocap, no canned animations, no SteamVR. Currently on the `motion-server` branch.

## Quick Start

1. Download the **latest release** from the [Releases page](https://github.com/HoppouAI/ProjectGabriel-Remastered/releases) and extract it.
2. Open the folder and run `setup.bat`. It downloads Python 3.12, installs everything, and asks about GPU support.
3. When setup finishes, run `run.bat` to start Gabriel.

If Windows is hiding file extensions, the files will just say `setup` and `run` without the `.bat`. Same thing.

The WebUI is at **http://localhost:8766** once running.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Two virtual audio cables** for routing audio through VRChat. [VB-Audio Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/) (standard) plus [VB-Audio Hi-Fi Cable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/#DownloadASIOBridge) (secondary).
- **A Gemini API key** from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). Free tier works.
- **Python 3.11 or 3.12.** The setup script auto-downloads 3.12 if needed. 3.13+ is not supported.
- **VRChat** on the same machine, with OSC enabled in the action menu.

### Arch Linux with Docker

The container runs Gabriel headlessly. Install Docker Engine and the Compose
plugin, start Docker, and make sure PipeWire's PulseAudio socket is available:

```sh
sudo pacman -S docker docker-compose pipewire-pulse
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
systemctl --user enable --now pipewire pipewire-pulse
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$USER"
sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"
cp .env.example .env
```

Log out and back in after adding yourself to the `docker` group if Docker
commands report a permission error.

Edit `.env` if your user ID, group ID, or PulseAudio socket differs from the
defaults. Then prepare the private config and launch:

```sh
cp config.yml.example config.yml
cp config/prompts/prompts.yml.example config/prompts/prompts.yml
cp config/prompts/appends.yml.example config/prompts/appends.yml
cp config/prompts/personalities.yml.example config/prompts/personalities.yml
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/HoppouAI/ProjectGabriel-Plugins.git /tmp/ProjectGabriel-Plugins
cp -r /tmp/ProjectGabriel-Plugins/pocket_tts plugins/
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f
```

In `config.yml`, select the local backend and configure LM Studio, local speech,
and Pocket TTS:

```yaml
backend: local
local:
  llm:
    base_url: "http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1"
    model: "local-model"
  stt:
    engine: faster_whisper
    whisper_model: small
    language: pt
tts:
  provider: pocket_tts
plugins:
  enabled: true
  pocket_tts:
    language: portuguese_24l
    voice: rafael
memory:
  rag_provider: local
```

Start the LM Studio server on port 1234 with a chat model loaded. The Docker
container uses host networking, so `127.0.0.1` reaches LM Studio. No Gemini key
is used. Faster-Whisper and Pocket TTS download their models on first start;
after those downloads, inference and speech stay local. Disable `yolo.enabled`
and leave `face_tracker.enabled` false: a headless container cannot capture
the desktop. OSC uses the host network, so the default `127.0.0.1` destination
reaches VRChat on this Arch machine. The WebUI is available at
**http://localhost:8766**. Docker restarts the app after a crash and keeps
configuration, memory, models, plugins, and sound files in the mounted folders.

Keyboard crouch/crawl and screen capture are unavailable in this headless
setup. Voice input/output requires the host PipeWire PulseAudio service. For
NVIDIA inference, install and configure the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, then
uncomment `gpus: all` in `docker-compose.yml`; CPU operation is the default.

## Audio Routing

After starting Gabriel, set these in the Windows Volume Mixer (right-click the speaker icon):

| Application | Output | Input |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Python | CABLE Input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable) | Hi-Fi Cable Output (VB-Audio Hi-Fi) |
| VRChat | Hi-Fi Cable Input (VB-Audio Hi-Fi) | Default / Microphone |

Then in VRChat Settings &rarr; Audio &rarr; Microphone:

- **Microphone Device:** `CABLE Output` (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)
- **Noise Suppression:** OFF
- **Activation Threshold:** 0%

---

## Configuration

Everything lives in `config.yml`. Key sections:

| Section | What it does |
|:---|:---|
| `backend` | `gemini_live` for Gemini Live or `local` for LM Studio and local speech |
| `gemini` &rarr; `api_key` | Required for `gemini_live` or Gemini-backed RAG |
| `gemini` &rarr; `model` | Which Gemini Live model to use with `backend: gemini_live` |
| `local` &rarr; `llm`, `stt` | LM Studio endpoint/model and local speech recognition settings |
| `tts` &rarr; `provider` | Speech output provider; `pocket_tts` runs locally |
| `gemini` &rarr; `voice` | Prebuilt voice: Puck, Charon, Kore, Fenrir, Aoede, Leda, Orus, Zephyr |
| `gemini` &rarr; `vad` &rarr; `mode` | Voice Activity Detection: `auto` (server-side) or `silero` (local) |
| `gemini` &rarr; `thinking` | How much the model reasons before it answers |
| `vrchat` &rarr; `osc_ip`, `osc_send_port`, `osc_receive_port` | OSC IP and ports |
| `vrchat_api` | VRChat account credentials for avatar switching, friends, etc |
| `yolo` &rarr; `enabled` | Toggle person/face tracking |
| `memory` | Memory backend settings |
| `plugins` | Plugin loader and trust settings |

Prompt files live in `config/prompts/`. Personalities live in `config/prompts/personalities.yml`.

### Models

Any Gemini Live model works. Set `model` under the `gemini` section in `config.yml`.

| Model | Notes |
|:---|:---|
| `gemini-3.8-live` | Fastest. Reasons on its own, no thinking settings needed. |
| `gemini-3.8-live-extended-thinking` | Thinks harder in the background. Slower, better at multi-step problems. |
| `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` | Previous generation. |
| `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-*` | Legacy models. |

Older and newer models are all supported. Anything not recognised falls back to the closest generation based on the version number and says so in the console on startup.

**Thinking settings fix themselves.** The `thinking` section has a token budget for 2.5 models and a level for 3.x models. Whichever one your model does not understand gets dropped automatically, and the reason is printed on startup. Picking the wrong one cannot break a session.

### Tools (`config/tools.yml`)

`config/tools.yml` controls what Gabriel can do. It is generated on first run and updated automatically as tools are added, so you never need to write it from scratch.

Each tool can be a plain on/off switch:

```yaml
tools:
  playMusic: false
```

Or the longer form, which also sets the call type:

```yaml
tools:
  playMusic:
    enabled: true
    type: non_blocking
    scheduling: silent
```

**`type`** is how the model waits for the tool:

| Value | What happens |
|:---|:---|
| `auto` | Default. Lets the model decide, which means blocking on 2.5 and 3.1, and non-blocking on 3.8. |
| `blocking` | The model pauses and waits for the result before saying anything else. Predictable ordering, but the conversation stalls while the tool runs. |
| `non_blocking` | The tool runs in the background and the model keeps talking. Use this for anything slow. |

`gemini-3.8-live-extended-thinking` rejects blocking function calls outright, so every tool is switched to non-blocking automatically on that model.

**`scheduling`** only applies to non-blocking tools, and decides what the model does when the result arrives:

| Value | What happens |
|:---|:---|
| `when_idle` | Default. Finishes what it is saying, then brings the result up. |
| `interrupt` | Cuts itself off to report the result straight away. |
| `silent` | Never mentions it, just knows it for later. Good for background tasks. |

As with thinking, a model that cannot honor a setting simply ignores it and the reason appears in the console. Settings on a tool you have switched off are not reported at all.

Plugins add their tools under `plugin_tools`, grouped by plugin name. Whether a plugin itself loads is controlled by its own `plugins/<name>/plugin.yml`, not by `tools.yml`.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>"I can't log into VRChat" / "VRChat API calls fail with 401"</strong></summary>

Delete `data/vrchat_cookies.json` and restart Gabriel. The auth cookies can get stale or corrupted, and deleting them forces a fresh login on next attempt. If it still fails, double-check the `username` and `password` fields under the `vrchat_api` section in `config.yml`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"Is VRChat required?"</strong></summary>

Not at all. Gabriel runs just fine as a standalone voice AI. You can talk to him through Discord, the WebUI at `http://localhost:8766`, or any other interface. The Discord bot, social server, and local backend all work without VRChat even installed. He was designed with VRChat in mind and that's where all the OSC, vision, and navigation features live, but nothing forces you to use it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"Does the AI have to be named Gabriel?"</strong></summary>

No. Gabriel is just the project name and the default app name. Change it in `config.yml` under `app_name` and update your prompt files in `config/prompts/`. You can give him any name, personality, or backstory you want. Everything is configurable.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"How do I change the AI's voice?"</strong></summary>

Set the `voice` field under `gemini` in `config.yml` to any of the eight built-in names: Puck, Charon, Kore, Fenrir, Aoede, Leda, Orus, or Zephyr. Puck and Kore are the most popular. You can also use external TTS providers like Hoppou or Chirp 3 HD through the local backend.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"Does the AI have to be male?"</strong></summary>

Not at all. Gabriel is fully customizable. Pick a female voice like Aoede or Zephyr, write a prompt that describes a female persona, and that's who your AI is. The project name is just a name. Everything from voice to personality to gender is defined by your config and prompt files.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"Gemini Live disconnects with error 1007 or 1008"</strong></summary>

These are precondition failures, usually caused by sending audio while the model is mid-turn or sending text before the model is ready. Try switching `mode` under `gemini` &rarr; `vad` to `silero` since it gates audio during tool calls and model speech and is generally more stable on 3.1 models.

If you're on a 2.5 model, make sure `context_window_compression` is set to `enabled: true` under `gemini` to prevent the session from hitting the token limit.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"I'm getting 429 rate limit errors"</strong></summary>

Add backup API keys under `gemini` &rarr; `backup_keys` in `config.yml`. Gabriel rotates keys automatically when he hits a quota limit. Each free API key has its own quota, so having a few on hand keeps things running.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"The AI can't hear me" / "It never responds"</strong></summary>

Check your audio routing in the Windows Volume Mixer. Python's output should go to `CABLE Input`, and VRChat's microphone should be set to `CABLE Output`.

If routing looks right, try lowering `silence_duration_ms` under `gemini` &rarr; `vad`. 200ms is the default and works well for natural conversation.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"The AI voice sounds robotic or choppy"</strong></summary>

Disable the voice effects chain by removing or commenting out the voice config in `config/voices.yml`. Pedalboard effects can sometimes introduce artifacts. If that fixes it, re-enable effects one at a time to find the culprit.

Also try switching to a different Gemini voice. Puck and Kore tend to be the most reliable.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"Setup fails / packages won't install"</strong></summary>

Make sure you have Visual C++ build tools installed. If you get compiler errors during the `uv sync` step, download [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) and make sure the "Desktop development with C++" workload is selected.

If you're on an ARM machine (Snapdragon X, etc), some packages like `pyaudio` may need special handling. Hit up the Discord for help.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"How do I enable the GPU for faster vision/YOLO?"</strong></summary>

Run `setup.bat` and choose option 2 (NVIDIA GPU ONLY). Setup installs the CUDA 12.8 build, tests it on your GPU, and automatically drops back to CUDA 12.6 if it doesn't work.

To swap manually instead:

```bash
# GTX 16xx / RTX 20-series and newer (including RTX 50-series)
.\bin\uv.exe pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128 torch torchvision torchaudio --reinstall

# GTX 10-series and older
.\bin\uv.exe pip install --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126 torch torchvision torchaudio --reinstall
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"The chatbox shows garbled text or cuts off"</strong></summary>

VRChat's chatbox has a 144 character hard limit. Gabriel auto-paginates with `(1/N)` prefixes, but if you're seeing issues, try adjusting `chatbox_page_delay` under `vrchat` in `config.yml` (default is 3 seconds).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"Can I run this on Linux?"</strong></summary>

The project targets Windows first. On Linux, the Docker setup supports the
headless Gemini/OSC workflow with host audio forwarding. Desktop capture and
keyboard injection are not available in that container setup. For the
supported Arch configuration, see [Arch Linux with Docker](#arch-linux-with-docker).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"Where do I put my music/SFX files?"</strong></summary>

Drop them in `sfx/music/`. Gabriel can play them via the soundboard & play music tool(s).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"How do I add a custom TTS voice?"</strong></summary>

Gabriel supports several TTS providers out of the box: Hoppou AI cloud, Google Chirp 3 HD, and TikTok TTS.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>"My config.yml got corrupted / things are acting weird"</strong></summary>

Don't panic. Compare your `config.yml` against `config.yml.example`. The example file always reflects the current schema. Look for missing keys, wrong indentation, or leftover values from an older version. If you recently upgraded, new fields may have been added that you're missing.

</details>

---

## Plugins

Gabriel has a drop-in plugin system. Create a folder under `plugins/<name>/` with a `plugin.yml` manifest and an `__init__.py` that subclasses `Plugin`. Plugins can:

- Register Gemini function-calling tools
- Register custom TTS providers, and custom STT / ASR providers for the local backend
- Grab vision frames the AI sees on demand (`ctx.capture_vision_frame()`)
- Write to the VRChat chatbox
- Inject text into the system prompt
- Subscribe to lifecycle events

Official plugins live at **[HoppouAI/ProjectGabriel-Plugins](https://github.com/HoppouAI/ProjectGabriel-Plugins)**. The author guide is in [plugins/README.md](plugins/README.md).

### Installing plugins

Run **`plugins.bat`** for an interactive TUI that pulls the latest plugin
list from the official repo, shows what's already installed, and one
keypress installs a plugin folder plus runs `bin\uv.exe pip install` for
any dependencies it needs. Press `L` inside the TUI to install from a
local folder or `G` to point it at a fork instead.
